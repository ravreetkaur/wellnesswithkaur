 Love is one of the most complicated of human emotions. To master the art of "love", we must look within first.  We tend to focus so much of our energy into loving others but we forget the most important and beautiful form of love: **self-love**. 
 
 You would think that the love you abundantly offer to the world should be just as easy as or easier than the love you give yourself, right? But you know that is far from the truth! 

One aspect of my self-love journey: 

I personally have struggled with self-love for the longest time. To this day, I cannot completely define it. It all started in my teens when I deprived my body of the essential nutrients through my teenage years by not eating breakfast because I was afraid of gaining weight. I ate all the wrong things and never exercised consistently. It felt like too much effort at that time. 

**Lesson 1: <font color="red">Don't skip meals</font> to lose weight ever or be healthier, it almost always backfires!!!!! - Research shows people tend to snack more and exercise less if they don't eat breakfast regularly, so eat your breakfast lovelies!**

Self-love is not just about having a balanced diet or exercising every day. But it can be the starting point. At least for me, it really was. During my university days, I started eating breakfast again because I had been in a lot more stress and wanted to be fitter in a healthier way because I read about how important breakfast really is in your daily diet. 

I had zero idea of where and when to start. I used to work out at a university gym with equally inexperienced friends (we had some good laughs and memories) but was too intimidated by all the equipment and people at the gym. I did little to no research on the topic and did not have much interest in it back then. I tried dance classes and Muay Thai but could not keep up either. I hated running and cardio even though it was a lot easier and requires little preparation. I hiked occasionally but never really enjoyed it because I found it too difficult.

It was only after I finished my undergraduate degree, I properly began my fitness journey! I joined the gym with my own hard-earned money :D, it really was the starting point to a healthier lifestyle. At the end of 2019, I started working out more consistently. 


*Pro tip: <font color="red">Don't stick to just one fitness strategy</font> of going to the gym or doing cardio. If you are looking to find your fitness mantra, try a bunch of things (and give it a try few times, first time is always the hardest, it does get easier)! Could be anything that moves your body; from taking dance classes, yoga to hiking whatever makes you break a sweat and feel accomplished. Also, make a list of things you have tried so far and prioritize those you find most fulfilment in.*
