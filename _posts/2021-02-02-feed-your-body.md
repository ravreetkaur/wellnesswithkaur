From all the content I consume every day on social media (podcasts, IG influencers, motivational pages), my own personal experiences and my specialization on positive psychology (For those of you, who might not know me, I am working towards a postgraduate in positive psychology). I want to share all the amazing tips and incredible things I have personally learnt first/second hand with you lovely readers. There are three pillars of self-care and self-love from my perspective: **Mind, Body and Soul.  Let us talk about body first.**

I am not a guru or a specialist in these areas. However, I am someone who actively pursues living a more meaningful and purposeful life and think you all might benefit from my personal insights too. It begins not just externally but also internally. Let us talk about the external world first.

## My take on exercise and working out: 
I am sure you know that self-care promoted by the media and society is caring for our physical health. It can be done in several ways. You work on your body by playing your favourite sport, going to the gym, and eating healthier. Nowadays, a lot of you probably have this aspect figured out. Then, you set short term or long-term goals and work to achieve them depending on your mood, free time, and priorities. 

This is completely normal because not everyone is into fitness of a particular sort. Therefore, it is important to experiment with what type of exercise or physical activity you enjoy and find the most pleasure in. For me, it is going to the gym, swimming, sometimes yoga and hiking. If you are still figuring it, keep going! You will find some sort of physical exercise that you will find joy in. **It is vital that you do not force yourself to fit into society’s standard of physical health and do what your body responds actively.** Try not to restrict yourself to one form of exercise or sport, it is always good to mix it up and keep an open mind. You will be surprised what you might like.

## My take on nutrition and food: 
I recently took an online course *on introduction to nutrition and food by Stanford University.* I would like to share some of the knowledge and experience regarding that as well. 

Personally, I have tried a low-carb diet throughout the time I was actively an ambassador at Nu Skin. I learned a lot of good tricks on clean eating during my time there. I tried to incorporate low amount of carbs, more protein (meat) and vegetables and fruit into my diet. I did incorporate some items of that diet into my daily routine such as avocados, yoghurt, variety of fruit, lean meat, and protein (chicken breast, salmon, shrimps, egg whites etc). It taught me a great deal about nutrition and diet. I will be forever grateful for that. 

> **However, according to purely the knowledge I gained from this course:**
> Low carb diets that promote significant protein and fats by cutting carbs can lead to serious health issues in the long run.

If you are planning to eat clean and healthier, I recommend the above food groups to be incorporated in your diet, but I do believe carbs are extremely important in one’s diet. <font color="red">Be wary of diets that suggests you losing weight by cutting a huge chunk of carbs.</font> I had done it for a year, and I realise, I was hungry a lot faster and in fact, tried other unhealthy ways to supplement my carbs intake by snacking in between meals. Therefore, I do believe in having sustainable carbs for all the meals. 

The tricky part is choosing the right carbs. You want to be able to incorporate more whole grains rather than just refined carbs. (trust me, being a huge foodie, I struggle with these sometimes also). Some examples refined and complex carbs broken down for you: 

**Whole grains: brown rice, oats, Quinoa, whole-wheat bread, sweet potatoes**

**Refined carbs: white bread/rice, sugary breakfast cereal, instant Oatmeal, white potatoes**
